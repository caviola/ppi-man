First of all: THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION. DO NOT USE ON PRODUCTION!

ppi-man is a PHP script to manage your Tiny Core Linux (TCL) PPI installation.
It esentially allows you to uninstall a PPI-compatible extension along
with its dependencies.

To ensure that your PPI extensions are not being used, you should 
boot TCL in TCE mode (tce=xyz boot code) before using this script.

You need to edit ppi-man.ini to reflect the location of your "tclocal" directory.
